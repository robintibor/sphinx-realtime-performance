For rizzoma :)

This script tests the performance of Real Time Indices of Sphinx.

Usage:
```
cake --inputfile <wikipediaxmlfile> run-perf
```

It expects there to be a directory 'perffile' where to store the insertion and the searchlogs.

To clean the sphinx real time index after inserting use
```
cake clean-sphinx
```
